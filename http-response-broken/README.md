# Detecting Client Disconnection in an HTTP Handler

## Problem Description
In a typical HTTP server, when a response is written to the client, it is often assumed that the client successfully receives the response. However, if the client disconnects (e.g., closes the browser or aborts the request) before the server writes the response, the server might not immediately detect the disconnection. This behavior can lead to misleading logs, where the server reports a successful response despite the client having already disconnected.

For example:
```plaintext
2025/01/10 14:17:38 Request received, emulating calling a service (5 seconds), ctrl break client to emulate broken connection
2025/01/10 14:17:43 Response successfully written to the client
```

In this scenario, the client disconnected, but the server erroneously reported that the response was successfully written.

## Root Cause
The issue arises because of:
1. **Buffered Writes**: HTTP servers often buffer responses, delaying actual transmission.
2. **TCP Behavior**: The TCP stack might not immediately detect a closed connection until it attempts to send data.
3. **Lack of Immediate Error Feedback**: Writing to a closed connection doesn’t always return an error unless the server explicitly attempts to flush the response or checks the connection state.

## Solution
To detect client disconnection reliably:
1. **Use the Request Context**:
   The HTTP server provides a `Context` through `r.Context()`, which is canceled when the client disconnects. This can be used to detect and handle disconnections before writing a response.

2. **Force Immediate Flush**:
   Use the `http.Flusher` interface to flush the response buffer immediately after writing, ensuring that any errors from sending the response are caught promptly.

### Example Code Highlight
Below are the key changes to address the issue:

#### Detecting Disconnection with Context
Use the request’s `Context` to monitor for client disconnections during long-running operations:

```go
select {
case <-r.Context().Done():
    log.Println("Client disconnected before processing completed")
    return
case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
    // Simulate a service delay
}
```

#### Forcing Immediate Flush
After writing the response, flush it to immediately attempt delivery and catch any connection errors:

```go
_, err := w.Write([]byte("Hello, World!\n"))
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error writing response: %v", err)
    return
}

if f, ok := w.(http.Flusher); ok {
    f.Flush() // Force immediate flush
}
```

## Results
After implementing these changes:
- The server correctly detects when the client disconnects before completing the response.
- Example log output when the client disconnects:

```plaintext
2025/01/10 14:22:24 Request received, emulating service call (5 seconds)
2025/01/10 14:22:25 Client disconnected before processing completed
```

This ensures that the server handles such scenarios gracefully, improving reliability and debugging clarity.

## Conclusion
By combining `Context` cancellation checks and explicit flushing, the HTTP server can reliably detect client disconnections and handle them appropriately, avoiding misleading logs or assumptions about successful response delivery.
